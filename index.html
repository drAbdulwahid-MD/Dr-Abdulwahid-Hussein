            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Abdulwahid Hussein</strong>, and I am a medical student at <strong>Jimma University</strong>. Ever since I was young, I have been passionate about medicine and helping others. But at the same time, I am deeply fascinated by technology.</p>
            <p>I come from a loving family with <strong>two brothers and two sisters</strong>. They have always supported me in both my medical journey and my growing interest in tech.</p>
            <p>Even though medicine is my primary passion, I strive to learn something new about **technology** every single day. Whether it's web development, programming, or anything tech-related, I am eager to explore and grow.</p>
